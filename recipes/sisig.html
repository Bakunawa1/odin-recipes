            <strong>Description</strong>
            <br><br>
            Nothing goes to waste in Filipino food. In the culinary capital of <em>Pampanga</em>, they turn the pork's cheeks, head and liver into a sizzling dish called <em>Sisig</em>. The crunchy and chewy texture of this appetizer is a perfect match for a cold beer. Serve with hot sauce and Knorr seasoning to suit the preference of you and your buddies. Credit goes to Aling Lucing, who invented this dish at a humble stall along the train railways in Angeles City, Pampanga.
