            <strong>Description</strong>
            <br><br>
            No list of Filipino food would be complete without <em>adobo</em>. A ubiquitous dish in every household in the Philippines, it's Mexican in origin. But Filipinos found that cooking meat (often chicken and pork) in vinegar, salt, garlic, pepper, soy sauce and other spices was a practical way to preserve it without refrigeration. This cooking style can be applied to different meats or even seafood.
